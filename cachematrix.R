## Overall description of the two functions: 
## makeCacheMatrix does....
## cacheSolve does....


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
## x is the matrix you want to work with
    
    
}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        ## As above, x is the matrix you want to work with
}
